Welcome to the first post on my first genuinely personal website. It's interesting, I've built plenty of sites, but never made one for myself. I'm excited to try out some new ideas and branch out with some languages and frameworks i've never used before. I'm also planning on using this as a central hub for some of the personal and professional nonsense i've worked on over the past few years. It's a bit skeletal right now but as I build up the framework for the site it should be pretty easy to bring up different environments and link them together into a more comprehensive whole. Watch here for more to show up.
