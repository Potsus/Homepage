In 2012 Brian Peacock told about a personal project he was working on for saving his onsite engineering calculations on his phone to the cloud so he could review them later on his computer. He wasn't trained in computer programming, but had put a lot of systems together into a functional-ish document editor with a lot of styling problems. I offered some help with the web interface and we cleaned up some areas, but never got much further than that. After he talked to [Jay Hotaling](http://jayhotaling.com/William_Jay_Hotaling/William_Jay_Hotaling.html) about it they decided to shop his project out to some tech incubators and asked me if I wanted to join the team. FastFig ended up gettin into [DreamIt](http://www.dreamit.com/), a high level tech incubator, and in December we dropped everything to go to Austin, TX and try our hand at building a startup.

Every part of this adventure was done a little bit [live](/images/do-it-live.jpg) but the night we left for Austin was one of the more ridiculous. Working backward, we had a presentation to the DreamIt partners at 8 am on January 3rd. New years being the first, we still had friends to say goodbye to and a 2013 to ring in. The appartment we had found in Austin was unfurnished and we would need a car while we were there so we elected to drive. Leaving from Haddonfield, NJ we had a ~1,660 mile drive which with no stops would take *26 hours*. ![Haddonfield to Austin](/images/hfield-austin.png) So after waking up on the first we got to work packing and by midnight we were ready to leave. The car had barely enough room for three people and leaving at 1 am on the 1st we had ~31 hours to not only get to Austin but *write and practice our presentation*. ![Timeline](/images/h-a-timeline.png)

So we set out, with a driver, a co-pilot who would give directions and work on the presentation, and in the back the third person could sleep. We did 2-3 hour shifts after which we would pull over, rotate the sleeper into driving, driving into co-pilot, and co-pilot into sleeper, so that we never had to *really* stop driving, because we honestly couldn't afford to. Nobody could sleep for the first couple shifts as we tethered our phones to our laptops and researched the other teams that got into DreamIt. I must have drawn the short straw, driving third with a shift starting just as the sun was coming up around 7am. That morning was bright and kept me awake, but the rest of the day was gray and sobering as fatigue kicked in. It started to hit us just how important sleeping was going to be if we wanted to make our deadline. 

Our only real stop came in Nashville, TN. Almost exactly halfway and probably 14 hours into the drive we rolled into Nashville at right around 2:30 pm if the EXIF data from the two pictures I took there is to be believed. ![Nashville sky with Freemasons](/images/nash-mason.jpg) We actually stopped and got lunch while we checked out the strip and saw some live music. I wish I had taken more (read: any) pictures while we were passing through. Wierdly the thing I remember most is the AT&T building looking like the PHB from Dilbert. ![Nashville AT&T Tower Comparison](/images/nash-tower.png) But by 4 we had to get out of there and with 12 hours to go and only 18 hours till our presentation it was getting a little close. 

For a while it was routine, I got some sleep thankfully and we worked and joked around. It was exhausting with mostly uninteresting countryside and drivers that drove exactly the speed limit, but didn't feel any neet to warn you with turn signals when they felt the need to be in our lane. I remember waking up after a brief nap to a poorly lit highway with nobody on it somewhere in Arkansas. We were getting worried we were going the wrong direction and needed to shift drivers anyway so we took the first ramp we saw and looked for a place to pull over. With no lighting to speak of we pulled over to the side of the road and lit up some flashlights only to realize we were in a graveyard, in the middle of the night, unsure where we were going, in meth country. Six hours to go.

I drive for maybe an hour but as we're getting closer to Dallas more and more road construction boxes us into a single lane still going ~50 miles an hour. Now we're tired, nobody has slept well and the shifts have been getting shorter as we feel less and less comfortable driving but this is getting ridiculous. Brian takes an hour before he's at wits end and switches out for Jay while I catch what little sleep I can. It's 1 am, ~24 hours after we started, and probably 36 since anyone has had proper sleep. We're long past working on the presentation, I think we finished it hours ago.

I wake up maybe 45 minutes later. Brian has passed out in the passenger seat and Jay needs a co-pilot as we get into the Megacity that is the DFW area. Jay and I are alone from here out but it goes well enough. The frequent roadwork takes its toll on both of us and I take over again. With 2 hours to go it's about 3:30 am, the day of and we still haven't even gotten to the appartment. One more hour of driving, Jay and I get out to slap each other and do jumping jacks in a McDonalds parking lot. We finally make it to Austin around 5:30 am, Brian wakes up on the way in and after a long look around we locate our appartment complex. What should be the triumphant moment for us is dashed as the complex has an automatic carded gate! We're stuck outside! Whatever, screw it lets just sleep in the parking lot.

It is at this point I'm made aware that the fourth member of our party actually flew in. Greg is staying at a beautiful hotel nearby and we blearily drive over to see if he's awake. He doesn't answer his phone and we don't know what room number he is but we head inside and wander around the georgeous, if empty, lobby, hoping against hope he'll reveal himself and already have cots set out. Sadly this whole paragraph is just a misdirect and he sleeps happily unaware of our plight.

We make our way back to the appartment complex and sit outside the gate trying to come up with a way in. We can't even park the car somewhere and walk in. We're standing aroud the car talking about trying to get into the office or maybe waiting till morning when suddenly *light*. There's a car coming out of the gate and we're all so sleep deprived we didn't even register it until he was halfway through the gate. Everyone starts yelling at each other to get in the car and the gate starts closing. Now it's a pretty wide gate, and someone could have just walked over and stopped it from closing *maybe*, but this is our finest hour and we jump into place, I wheel the car into line and gun it through the gate like it's Indiana Jones. Atleast it felt that way. 

Now inside the gate I do the worst parking job and at 6:04 we walk into an appartment I couldn't be happier to see. ![Home sweet sleep](/images/austin-house-pano.jpg) We must have hade the code to a keybox or something I have no idea how we got into the place. There were rented couches and beds that had been dropped off thankfully but I don't even know if I slept. With less than two hours to spare, after 29 hours of driving we still couldn't stop. I think we had maybe half an hour to crash before we had to shower and get dressed for our presentation. I think, thankfully, that Jay and Brian delivered a presentation wierdly more developed than the rest of the class and then I'm pretty sure we went back to the appartment and, finally, passed out.

I think we unpacked after waking up in the dark, but it was a hell of a first day. I don't think I even processed the office until the next day. This accound is probably riddled with innacuracy an vagueness after the last 5 years. Thankfully the few pictures I took have dates and times attached still, and Jay and Brian probably have some more I can corroborate with. I'll have to add them when I find them. I might do more retrospectives like this in the future for some of the more interesting bits in my time as a software developer.
